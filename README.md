1. [Sovereign state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state): A sovereign state is a state that has the highest authority over a territory. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, a government not under another, and the capacity to interact with other sovereign states. It is commonly understood that a sovereign state is independent. A sovereign state can exist without being recognized by other sovereign states. However, unrecognized states often have difficulty engaging in diplomatic relations with other sovereign states due to their lack of international recognition.

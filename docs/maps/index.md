# Wine Maps

A complete artifact package should include shapfile, KML and geojson data. The `geojson` format is standard used throughout this project for its inherent versatility. 

Every effort will be made to use existing standards where possible. Otherwise we will promote already proposed specifications or propose our own.

`us_{ava-name}.geojson` or `fr_{}`

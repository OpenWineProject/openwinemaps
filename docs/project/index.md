# The Open Wine Maps Project

Open Wine Maps is s a community effort to organize global geographical information relating to the world of wine. It is a purely educational project or for those interested in the geography of wine.

Current community focus areas are prioritized as primary, secondary and terriary.

Primary: 

1. Wine producing regions
2. Official and proposed viticulture areas potentially using the [Landform](https://schema.org/Landform) Schema.org type definition.
3. Winery's described using the [Winery](https://schema.org/Winery) Schema.org type definition 

Secondary:

1. Vineyards potentially using the [Landform](https://schema.org/Landform) Schema.org type definition.
2. Vines
3. Wines described with the [Product](https://schema.org/Product) Schema.org type definition
4. Winemaker potentially described using [Ronan Guilloux's](https://github.com/ronanguilloux) proposed [Winemaker](https://github.com/OpenWines/Ontology/blob/master/1.0/Winemaker.md) schema type an extention to the official [Person](https://schema.org/Person) Schema.org type definition

Tertiary:

1. Historical weather and planting data


The aspirations for this project are as board as the topic itself is defined:

> **cartography** /kär-tŏg′rə-fē/ noun
> 1. The art or technique of making maps or charts.
> 2. The art or business of forming charts or maps.
> 3. The making of maps and charts.
> 
> — _The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, 5th Edition_

Two very smart examples provided by the UC Davis Library GitHub and, as best as I can tell, [Ronan Guilloux](https://github.com/ronanguilloux) of OpenWines in France, [cite source] and [cite source], are providing some base assumptions and guiding principles.
